# movies
## Project Overview

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you‚Äôll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

This app uses the API from [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/)
 
## Why this project 

To become an Flutter developer, you must know how to bring particular mobile experiences to life. Specifically, you need to know how to build clean and compelling user interfaces (UIs), fetch data from network services, and optimize the experience for various mobile devices. You will hone these fundamental skills in this project.

By building this app, you will demonstrate your understanding of the foundational elements of programming for Flutter. Your app will communicate with the Internet and provide a responsive and delightful user experience.

## What I learned
- Fetch data from the Internet with theMovieDB API
- Use adapters and custom list layouts to populate list views
- Incorporate libraries to simplify the amount of code you need to write
- Build a fully featured application that looks and feels natural on both Android and IOS operating systems.

- Added search features so that you can search for movies by keyword
- Integrated Firebase Analytics, Crashlytics, Firebase AdMob
- Created a launcher icon using Adobe Photoshop
**Popular Movies uses the TMDb API but is not endorsed or certified by TMDb.**
I learned how to link my app to Google AdMob, design an app icon, how to reply on the feedback on improvements, 
and use the Google Play Console to manage my app. If you like my Popular Movies app, 
you can download it on Google Play. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sallam.movies&hl=en">Download Link</a>.
